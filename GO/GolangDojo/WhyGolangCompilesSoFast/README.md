There are only 20 something keywords in the google programming language compared to java in the 60s and close to 100 for c++ and these numbers they can add up quickly

# 2. No unused dependencies

your ide or your code editor is going to be complaining constanly throughout your development process about your unused importer for example so that final program that you come up with is going to have less flow of less the things that it needs to compile

# 3. No circular dependencies

# 4. No symbol table when parsing.

# 5. No header files.

# 6. No virtual machine.
