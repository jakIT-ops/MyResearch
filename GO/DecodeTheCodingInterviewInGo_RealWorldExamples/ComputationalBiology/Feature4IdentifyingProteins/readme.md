## Descriptionin

We have an unknown sequence of genomes that is thought to be a new protein. To accept or reject this sequence as a new protein, one method we can use is to identify it as a palindromic sequence. A palindrome is a string that reads the same from the start as the end.

We’ll be provided with a sequence of genomes in the form of a string. Our task is to identify whether these genomes constitute a palindrome to be considered as a potential protein.

# Solution

A recursive approach can be used to solve this problem. We can keep comparing the first and last elements of the string. If these values are equal, then the updated string, with the matched entries removed, can be sent to the recursive function.

Let’s see how we might implement this functionality:

1. Define the following base case:

	* If the given sequence has a length equal to zero or one, it will return true, since a string of size 0 or 1 is, a palindrome by definition.

2. If the above-mentioned base conditions are not met, we move to the recursive case.

3. If the first and last indexes are equal, we’ll call the function recursively on the argument string minus the matched characters.

4. Next, we pass the modified string sequence to the recursive method, which will compare values from the next index to the start of the string while decrementing the last index by 1.

5. The recursive call will terminate when the above-mentioned base cases are true, or when the values do not match at their respective positions.
