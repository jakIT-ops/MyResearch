## Description

Proteins are characterized by long palindrome sequences of nucleotides, where a character represents each nucleotide. We have received a sample that may be a protein. However, the nucleotides in this sample may have been rearranged due to a mutation.

Given a sequence of nucleotides, our task is to check if any permutation of the given sequence is a protein, that is, a palindrome. We should return true if it is a protein, and return false if it is not a protein.

## Solution

If some permutation of a sequence with an even length is a palindrome, every nucleotide in the sequence must appear an even number of times. Similarly, if a permutation of a sequence with an odd length is a palindrome, every nucleotide, except one, must appear an even number of times. So, in the case of a sequence being a palindrome and when there is a sequence of an odd length, the number of nucleotides with an odd number of occurrences cannot exceed 1. Similarly, in the case of a sequence with an even length, the number of nucleotides with an odd number of occurrences is 0.

Suppose we are given a sequence, s, and we expect all the nucleotides in s to appear an even number of times, except for perhaps one of them. So we can check if a nucleotide appears an odd number of times in the sequence. If more than one nucleotides appear an odd number of times, then s cannot be a palindrome. To do so, we can use a hashmap that stores the nucleotide and its occurrences.

We can traverse s, and for every new nucleotide found in it, we can create a new entry in the map for this nucleotide with the number of occurrences as 1. Whenever we find the same nucleotide again, we can increment the number of occurrences of that nucleotide.

In the end, we can traverse over the hashmap and count the number of characters with an odd number of occurrences. If this count exceeds 1, we can conclude that no palindromic permutation of this sequence is a protein. However, if the count remains less than 2 throughout the hashmap traversal, then we can conclude that the sequence is a protein.
