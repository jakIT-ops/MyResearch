## Description

Uber is one of the most popular ride-hailing applications. It provides a choice of a variety of vehicles to the passengers that use it for transport. Uber always uses an optimal path to save its passengerâ€™s time. The terrain is represented as a 2D grid. A passenger waits on one end of the grid and a driver is present on another end. This feature will show us how to find the optimal path for the driver to get to the passenger.

## Solution

A new path metric is evaluated. The terrain is represented as a 2D grid, and the cost of going from one point to an adjacent one is given as an integer.
