# Introduction

### What is and API

Much like humans communicate with each other verbally or through gestures, softwares need an API to communicate with each other. An application programming interface or API connects one software endpoint to another. An API describes the URLs and method of sending data in request parameters to the API. The API then processes the data and sends back appropriate information in the form of a response. Therefore, the API enables communication between two software components or programs.
