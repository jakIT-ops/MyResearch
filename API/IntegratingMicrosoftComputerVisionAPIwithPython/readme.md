# Introduction

## What is the Microsoft Computer Vision API?

[Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/#overview) provides a cloud-based [API for computer vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) called Microsoft Computer Vision API. This API gives access to advanced algorithms for image processing and returning information. Users do not need to have any prior expertise in machine learning. Instead, they can simply upload an image or video, or provide a URL to be analyzed by the algorithm according to the inputs and user choices.

## What is the Image Analysis API?

The Computer Vision Image Analysis API extracts visual elements from image inputs, thereby giving it the ability to recognize specific features. It can recognize human faces, brand logos, and even check for adult content. Additionally, it can describe images in human-understandable words.

Using the Image Analysis API, we can gather valuable information from images by performing the following actions:

* Tagging visual elements
* Image categorization
* Logo and object detection
* Image description
* Facial recognition
* Thumbnail generation
* Content moderation
