## Reddit's API

Using the Reddit API endpoints, we can build many valuable tools for themselves and others. A typical example of Reddit's API in action is a comment bot, which scrapes new posts and comments on them. Imagine a sentiment analyzing application that can read the incoming posts on a subreddit. It can respond with a motivational quote whenever it finds a negative sentiment in the post. In addition, as Reddit has abundant text, it is usually used to train machine learning algorithms at very large scales.
