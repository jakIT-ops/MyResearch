They allow them to make informed decisions considering the impacts of the forthcoming weather.

AccuWeather APIs provide valuable insights to users. They allow them to enhance safety and minimize risks and losses by enabling them to better understand the weather and its possible impacts.

## Get Started with AccuWeather APIs

[AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/) supports a number of weather APIs that provide us with up-to-date and highly accurate forecasts around the globe. It provides utility APIs that lets users retrieve unique identifiers and geographical coordinates for various locations. This information is useful because most of the APIs we cover in this course require the locationKey of a location, rather than its name, as a parameter.

### Types of APIs

AccuWeather offers two types of APIs: Core weather API and MinuteCast API. The Core weather API provides endpoints to get daily and hourly weather forecasts, current conditions, and daily index data, among others. Moreover, it provides endpoints to search for locations all around the world, including cities and countries. The MinuteCast API allows us to get a 120-minute precipitation forecast for a specific location.

Both APIs provide a range of subscription packages to meet the exact needs of customers. In this course, we use the free subscription package for the Core weather API.
