# Introduction

### Overview of Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics and computer sciences where a machine is trained to understand natural language (text and speech). The goal is to completely understand human language and itâ€™s writing style, then respond to it. NLP has become increasingly popular as people rely more on search engines and technical programs to solve their queries. These technical programs include tools for processing conversations and better understanding them. As developers, we can create applications and websites to host Natural Language Processing programs, which is where NLP API comes in.

### Cloudmersive Natural Language Processing API

Cloudmersive is an online platform that contains portfolios of APIs for handling Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Image Recognition, and more. This platform provides different services and solutions for APIs.


In this course, we will be examining the API of Natural Language Processing. [Cloudmersive NLP API](https://api.cloudmersive.com/docs/nlp.asp#introduction) is a great tool for exploring different operations of NLP. The operations include:

* Analytics
* Language detection
* Rephrasing
* Segmentation
* Language translation
