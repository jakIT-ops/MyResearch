<p>There are broadly three categories of data:</p>

1. <b>Structured Data: </b>

   <p>has some pre-defined organizational property about it that makes it easily searchable and analyzable. The data is backed by a model that dictates the size of each field of the data: its type, length, and any restrictions on what values it can take on.</p>

2. <b>Unstructured Data: </b>

   <p> is characterized by a lack of organization and a data model that describes the structure of a single record or attributes of any individual fields within the record.</p>

3. <b>Semi-structured Data: </b>

   <p> is a cross between structured and unstructured data, and though thereâ€™s no explicit data model or structure definition, one may be implied. Semi-structured data contains semantic tags, but does not conform to the structure associated with typical relational databases.</p>
