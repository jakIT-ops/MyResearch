## What is Perl?

`Perl` was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make text processing easier. Before Perl, almost all text processing on Unix-like systems was done with a conglomeration of tools that included `sed` and `awk,` the various shell programming languages, and `C` programs.
