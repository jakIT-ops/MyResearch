# 1. Introduction: Senior Developer

## The senior title is case dependent

It turns out that “senior developer” is a very broad title in this industry. Going from “ok, this person is technically not entry-level anymore” to “anywhere else this person would be a staff or Principal, but we believe in a flat hierarchy and call everyone senior. Deal with it.” It’s a little like a “passport” title. It is understood almost everywhere, but exactly how one title translates to another between companies is messy and case dependent.

## Responsibilities as a senior developer

Because I, myself, am somewhere on the senior developer spectrum, I can’t share from personal experience how to get to the next level. However, I can infer from the advice of others, triangulate again from engineering ladders, and offer some informed opinions about how to do well. However, my opinions are just my own. You should assess this chapter with a more critical eye than others. The further we depart from beginner territory, the more diverse and, let’s face it, outright contradicting people’s lived experiences become.


# 2. Solutions vs. Patterns

## Solving a new problem

You might be familiar with the industry-standard set of solutions to common problems. You know your tools well and can wield them effectively to solve problems you or others have seen before. The challenge comes when you run into new problems. Problems your tools were never designed for, under constraints and at scales that invalidate convenient assumptions. When your tools stop serving you, your knowledge of them does too.

## Don’t define yourself with a tool

Knowing how to use your tools is good, but knowing when not to use them is better. If you define yourself by your tool (“I am a ${FRAMEWORK} programmer”), you will try to solve every problem with that tool. This approach leads you to either fail or come up with unnecessarily convoluted solutions (still a failure, but way more expensive).

## Understand underlying design patterns

To overcome this, you need to understand the underlying design patterns that inform your tools and accept that nothing comes truly free. When you have a wide toolkit of design patterns and a good understanding of what they solve and what they trade-off, you will be able to repurpose tools or build your own. This knowledge will last regardless of language and can be reapplied at multiple levels of your stack. It scales incredibly well and helps you learn faster the more you learn, which is one of the core drivers to a superlinear Big L.


# 3. Velocity vs. Maintainability

## Tradeoffs change with project maturity

Most people today understand both the intended spirit and unintended consequences of “Move fast and break things.” However, what is less well understood is how tradeoffs change as project maturity changes.

## Make the right tradeoffs

As a junior, your velocity and impact are low. Your main task is to get code working with seniors to catch you when you fall. Improving your own velocity is a perfectly reasonable thing to prioritize. If you do anything that isn’t up to code standards, your seniors will hold you accountable.

## Avoid future problems

If you don’t write maintainable software, you are just causing future problems for yourself. So:

## Optimize for velocity over maintainability

However, most organizations create incentives that optimize velocity over maintainability. One way to tell is whether the equal effort is spent learning from and tracking mistakes as is spent shipping features. A good first step is to establish a culture of blameless post-mortem (you can borrow AWS’s incident post-mortem template as a starting point).

# 4. Mentorship, Allyship, and Sponsorship

### Why mentorship and collaboration are important

"Individual contributor" is a misnomer when it comes to being a senior developer. There’s nothing individual about it; virtually every company expects their senior devs to be mentors for their juniors and force multipliers for their teams.

### Be an ally

As someone with a senior title, you have a lot of power to call out unconscious and systematic bias toward underrepresented minorities in your company. Be an ally. Our industry has tremendous diversity debt accumulated over the past half-century, and this is hurting us and society at large now. You don’t have to be “super woke” to recognize this simple fact. Unintentional sexism and racism occur in the big things like the hiring pipeline, promotion, and project distribution, right down to smaller things like code review and speaker representation.

### Sponsorship

Mentorship and allyship are great; sponsorship is even better. Talk is cheap - take an active role in opening doors for underrepresented people! Lara Hogan and Samantha Bretous give great advice on how to be a sponsor, but it is up to each of us to live this advice. When you actively sponsor someone up to a position of influence, the effects can ripple out for decades because they can then turn around and sponsor others.
