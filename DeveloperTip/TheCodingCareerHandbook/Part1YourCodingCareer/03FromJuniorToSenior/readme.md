# 1. Introduction: From Junior to Senior

### What counts as a senior developer?

As you become comfortable as a junior developer (and an intermediate level Developer/Software Engineer, if your company has one), you will naturally start looking toward the next level: senior developer.

What counts as a senior developer is not standardized, and everyone has strong opinions about it. To some, it is three years at a high-growth startup. For others, it can take anywhere from two to eight years. Still, some companies say they don’t care about the number of years (and may or may not mean it).

What other people think only counts so much. What really matters is what your company (or the other companies you interview at) looks for in a senior and whether they pay you commensurate with the market rate for senior developers. After all, a senior title without the pay is meaningless!

### Getting a role as a senior developer

Ultimately, getting that role as a senior developer is a two-step process:

* Getting enough (not all) of the prerequisite skills and accomplishments specified by the company.

* Successfully marketing yourself as meeting enough of the requirements to be hired into that role.

# 2. Acting for the Job You Want

## Develop qualities for a senior position

When surveyed, developers almost universally identify a few qualities that you should develop as you prepare for the next level:

* Solid technical expertise, full command of fundamentals

* Having impact on your team’s work

* Being able to work across other teams

* Seeing the “bigger picture”

* Communication, communication, communication

* Mentoring others

### See the bigger picture

Many people define senior developers as “being able to see the bigger picture.” Everyone agrees it’s important, but nobody quite knows how to define it. It has something to do with how your technical work fits in the context of the business/product or fits in the broader architecture of the codebase, balancing both its history and future roadmap. So, try to step back from your day-to-day work every so often and zoom out!


### Find out what you like

Before you make your big move, make sure you know what you want and take the time to position yourself accordingly in the preceding six to twelve months. Want to work on creating GraphQL APIs as a senior? Better to do it as a junior first.

The logic here is: You aren’t expected to make that much impact as a junior, but you certainly will as a senior. So, it can be worth it to jockey around a little bit longer as a junior or intermediate developer to ensure you are in the perfect spot for a career-making senior developer role you can wholeheartedly throw yourself into. Better yet, your company can institute formal support for employees making internal “[tours of duty](https://hbr.org/2013/06/tours-of-duty-the-new-employer-employee-compact)” to grow you while keeping you!

It can help to make a list of what you’ve enjoyed in your current job. Among your peers (you have been building your network, right?), make a note of things that seem particularly exciting to you and try to get exposure within your company or projects. It’s a two-way street— finding out what you like and are good at, and then positioning so that you can do even more of that.

# 2. Junior Engineer, Senior Engineer

## Junior-to-senior advice

For junior engineers who want some ideas for directions to improve, it can be an interesting exercise to do a series of contrasting statements. I went through a long list of junior-to-senior advice online and compiled these approximately thirty comparisons in four categories:

* Code

* Learning

* Behavior

* Team

### Code

* Juniors collect solutions. Seniors collect patterns.

* Juniors get code working. Seniors keep code working.

* Juniors deliver features. Seniors deliver outcomes.

* Juniors fix bugs after they create them. Seniors create tooling to preclude bugs.

* Juniors write tests because it’s required. Seniors require writing good tests because they’ve seen what happens when you don’t.

* Juniors hate technical debt. Seniors have written code that became technical debt (and know when to let it be and when to migrate).

* Juniors love to keep code DRY. Seniors Avoid Hasty Abstractions.

* Juniors try to write the best code the first time. Seniors understand code is read, moved, copied, and deleted far more than it is written.

* Juniors know how to use their tools. Seniors know when not to use them.

### Learning

* Juniors make one-off side projects. Seniors use their side projects daily, often to make themselves more productive at their day job.

* Juniors learn to find the right answers. Seniors learn to ask the right questions.

* Juniors know what they need to know. Seniors know what they don’t need to know.

* Juniors should absorb best practices from others. Seniors can derive best practices from first principles and personal pain.

* Juniors get stuck without docs and tutorials. Seniors aren’t afraid to read specs and view sources.

* Juniors might have strongly held beliefs. Seniors have had to change strongly held beliefs.

* Juniors question themselves when they fail. Seniors know they just need to give themselves more time and try again.

* Juniors stay on top of the news. Seniors keep track of trends.

* Juniors try to avoid mistakes. Seniors have made them all and know how to recover.

* Juniors laugh at software tropes. Seniors know there’s a grain of truth in all of them.

### Behavior

* Juniors seek the best. Seniors love the good enough.

* Juniors should say “Yes” often. Seniors should say “No” more.

* Juniors should try to do the jobs they are given. Seniors should redesign their jobs as needed.

* Juniors complain about open source. Seniors understand open source only works thanks to contributors, not complainers.

* Juniors solve problems. Seniors identify problems before they become problems.

* Juniors start from what others say. Seniors start with what they need.

* Juniors know how to build. Seniors know when to buy.

* Juniors compare developer experience. Seniors look for hidden costs in user experience and in abstraction leaks.

* Juniors write as an afterthought. Seniors weigh writing as much as coding.

* Juniors leave comments. Seniors provide context.

### Team

* Juniors work within their teams. Seniors know when and how to work across teams.

* Juniors grow their own output. Seniors grow their team’s output.

* Juniors pair to learn best practices. Seniors pair to share expertise and see things in a new light.

* Juniors get roped in. Seniors get to buy-in.

* Juniors must earn trust. Seniors inspire trust.

* Juniors seek out mentors. Seniors know how to learn from their peers.

* Juniors work on improving themselves. Seniors work on improving their team and being force multipliers through teaching, mentorship, and leadership.
