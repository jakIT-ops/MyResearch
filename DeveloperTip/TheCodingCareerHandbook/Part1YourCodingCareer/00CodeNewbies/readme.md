# Introduction

## Building your raw skills

As a code newbie, your chief job is building your raw skills. You can be taking a college course, a paid course online, a paid boot camp (like I did), or using great free resources like FreeCodeCamp, FrontendMasters, TreeHouse, The Odin Project, Codecademy, or the “University of YouTube” (like I also did).

## Learn the basics of web development

Coding careers are very diverse. You don’t have to do web development; there are other career paths like Data Science, Cybersecurity, Cloud, Dev Ops, and Mobile Dev. That being said, web development is by far the most popular, and you’ll probably have to learn a bit of it no matter what you do.

## Building your portfolio

The primary artifact you will produce is your portfolio, or, as I call it in the Marketing Yourself chapter, your “Proof of Work”, which can include a blog. You basically want to demonstrate passion and engagement with your chosen skill and build cool shit.

## Roadmap for newbies

However, there’s a lot else you can do on your way there:

### 1. Learn the lingo

You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with— so spend your time with other developers by plugging into talks and podcasts! I keep a list of awesome developer podcasts you can use, or you can find your own.


### 2. Make up levels for yourself

When you are learning on your own (especially after your formal learning phase), it can feel a little directionless since there is an infinite number of things you could be learning. The counter for this is gamifying learning. When I was learning JavaScript, I set the goal for myself to make a clone of jQuery. Then, I set other benchmarks like mastering React and Redux and then being able to make a Hacker News clone. You can do the same for whatever you’re focusing on! Some learning platforms even award you points and trophies for completing challenges and streaks. Yes, it’s a little corny, but lean into it!

### 3. Explore paid learning

Because there is so much free content available, it can be tempting to learn entirely for free. However, in my experience, the level of curation and quality of paid content is so much better that it is worth it. If you can afford it, look into the reputable paid learning courses in your community. For example, Educative, Egghead, Frontend Masters, Codecademy, ACloudGuru, and Pluralsight. As for Udemy, just be aware it has a very mixed reputation. Stick to the topmost reviewed instructors.

### 4. Make a public commitment

Having a public commitment helps you build your own team of cheerleaders and community. This helps give you the feedback you need to not feel alone in your journey, and it forces you to keep going when you might otherwise have given up on yourself. While Alexander Kallaway’s 100 Days of Code is a popular commitment, No Zero Days is what worked for me. If you’re uncomfortable in public, you can also keep a private learning journal; anything outside yourself works, so long as it keeps you accountable.

### 5. Find a community

You don’t have to make commitments to get community. CodeNewbies, FreeCodeCamp, DEV, CareerKarma, and CodingBlocks are great, welcoming communities that keep you company as you learn. A boot camp can be a great community, and you can even find free meetups like Codebar to learn in person or virtual mentors via Emma Bostian’s CodingCoach. If you belong to an underrepresented minority in tech, don’t forget that there are communities and organizations formed specifically to help people like you. These groups often have local chapters that can give you the mentors and friends you need to find your place in tech (yes, you belong here, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise).

### 6. Teach to learn

If you can find a group of peers, pick a topic and offer to teach it to them. You only find out all the things you didn’t know about a topic when you start preparing to teach it and then have to answer all the questions you didn’t think to ask. I did this very early on with React, and it was stressful but highly beneficial for me!

### 7. Cover your bases

Developer jobs aren’t 100% about coding new features all the time. Some might say they’re not even about coding the majority of the time! There are a lot of coding-adjacent things that developers do that you’ll want to learn about. You should be familiar with (or at least have an opinion on) everything in the Joel test, which includes source control, code review, and testing.

### 8. Start contributing to open source

Many open-source projects are very beginner-friendly, and you don’t even have to start off contributing code. In fact, it may not be the best idea to start by contributing code to large projects like Node or React, despite the bragging rights that might entail. It might be better to start with a smaller library you use or to help improve docs. This gets you involved with the basic mechanics of open source without needing you to catch up on a lot of contexts you may be missing.
