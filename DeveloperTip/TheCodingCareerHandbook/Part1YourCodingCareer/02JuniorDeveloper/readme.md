## Responsibilities as a junior developer

> “First, welcome to your new life! Ask questions! Find a work buddy with whom you feel comfortable asking any tech question. Never let anyone make you feel bad asking a question - there are no dumb questions. Ask a lot. Draw diagrams. Read the code. Reassert your assumptions. Breathe.” - Scott Hanselman

# 1. Finding Your Groove

## Building competence and ability to execute

Your job as a junior developer is to build competence and the ability to execute. It’s more important that you ask good questions than that you always have answers. Over time, you will learn to have an informed opinion that your employers rely on.

## Work on your problem-solving skills

Work on your problem-solving skills, and understand that we all have struggled like you are right now. Take some time to learn how to use a debugger. Debuggers are very beneficial when navigating new, undocumented, or poorly documented codebases or debugging weird issues. Do not give up if Stack Overflow or an issue on GitHub doesn’t have an answer. Sometimes, all you need to solve your problem is to take a short break or try to explain it to a rubber duck.


## Understand how to help them help you

Saying “I am stuck, but I have tried X, Y, and Z. Do you have any pointers?” to your lead is much better than saying, “This is beyond me.” When writing up an issue or bug report, help them help you by writing a good title, providing key details upfront, including error messages and environment/package versions without asking, providing a minimal reproduction of your issue, and explaining what you’ve tried and what you expected.

# 2. Making Mistakes


### It is okay to make mistakes

You will screw up, royally. It’s a matter of when; not if. It’s okay. You’ll survive. We have all been there.

It’s not your job to never make mistakes. It’s the job of your seniors and managers to ensure that both you and the company can recover from any mistakes you make.

### List of mistakes made by senior developers

Here’s a non-exhaustive list of mistakes that senior developers have made:

* Instagram DDOSed itself on the day of its launch because they forgot a favicon.

* Someone at Pixar ran rm -rf on Toy Story 2 and deleted 90% of the movie (two years and $100m worth of work).

* Accidentally taking the iPhone off the Apple Online Store

* A senior developer literally kicked all of Sierra Leone off the Internet during Ebola.

* Accidentally deleting the database while teaching someone how not to accidentally delete the database

* Mistakenly emailing 15k users every minute for two hours, then repeating the mistake with the apology email

* Every person saving their profile had it deleted instead.

* A word processor formatted the hard drive every 1024 saves.

* Someone went to the wrong building and took down the network of a completely unrelated company.

* Steam, Windows, and iTunes deleted all user data.

# 3. Adding Value


## Do good work

As long as you’ve got your basic responsibilities down, you’re going to want to say yes to whatever comes your way. If you bite off more than you can chew, it is your manager/team’s responsibility to help you out or to step in if things start going south. At the same time, make sure you do good work with the stuff you have committed to. The work that you do is ultimately your personal brand.

### Come out of your comfort zone

You might feel intimidated doing things beyond your comfort zone, but you’re going to have to get good at it to grow. Fight impostor syndrome by saying, “This is what I do.”

### Try to be a work sink

Try to be a work sink instead of a work generator. Proactively ask managers and product owners what you can take off their plate. Your job is to support them; when they look good, you look good. Ryan Holiday calls this the Canvas Strategy. Harry Truman puts it more pithily:

“It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.”

Of course, if you feel you are being exploited, stop.

### Show initiative

If you just wait around when you run out of things to do, you look lazy and unmotivated. Show initiative; there are always more things to do.


## Volunteer to write tests

Tests are the most common example of this. In fact, a really great way to start a new job is to volunteer to write tests.
