# Introduction: Beyond your Coding Career

## Recognize symptoms of burnout

Sometimes, churn can be bad, like the many, many cases of burnout in our industry. Please pace yourself. If you intend this career to be a sustainable one, you shouldn’t be running a marathon at a sprint pace. Recognize symptoms of burnout:

* Working late

* Irritability

* Not asking for help

* Wallflowering during technical conversations

* Insomnia/code nightmares

Also, look out for these symptoms in your coworkers. As technical people, we monitor software and hardware for problems, but we often forget the wetware (people) that are at the root.

Fortunately, the majority of people stop coding for a living for more positive reasons, like finding something that suits them better! If code is at the center of your universe and this sounds impossible to you right now, consider why the people who don’t code call the shots and why do they pay you to write code? They must get more value not coding for a living than you get coding for a living.

## Career paths beyond coding career

Here, we will briefly discuss what a moderately informed friend (me!) might tell you about five common paths (without having actually lived through all of them) of good churn.

* Engineering Management

* Product Management

* Developer Relations

* Developer Education

* Entrepreneurship


#  Engineering Management

Probably the most common path out of a coding career is becoming an engineering manager (EM). In many organizations, EMs:

* Make more money

* Have more impact

* Have a more central position in the company hierarchy and information flow

# Product Management

## Do PMs need to have a technical background?

Another “management-type” position that engineers often move into is product management (PM). Depending on who you survey, anywhere between 24% and 66% of PMs were previously developers. Ask anyone whether PMs need to have technical backgrounds, and you will get 600 words of “It Depends” dodging the question. You can code; that certainly does not hurt. Now, your task is to figure out whether product management is for you.

If you came into the tech world entirely via coding, PMs might seem like an odd breed of bullshit job from a distance. They show up every couple of weeks, tell everyone what to do, disappear to do god knows what, get mad when their meticulously color-coded Gantt charts run afoul of reality, and take credit for everything when stuff is shipped.

## Mini-CEOs of the product

I’m kidding. The variety of PM jobs and roles are even more diverse than EM roles if that is even possible. PMs are classically regarded as “mini-CEOs of the product,” entrusted with bridging the gaps between engineering, design, and business.

# Developer Relations

### Are you qualified for developer relations?

You are reading a course written by a developer relations professional. If you follow 75% of the advice here, you will be well qualified to be a developer relations professional. It just so happens that much of the same advice helps coders in the non-coding aspects of their careers (which is the only reason this course made sense to write).

So, if you’ve read the course and practiced these principles, strategies, and tactics, we can assume you’re qualified and should easily get the job. Our task now is to figure out whether you want the job.

### Titles for this job

There are many names for this job:

* Developer Evangelist

* Developer Relations

* Developer

* Developer Advocate

* Developer Experience Engineer

For convenience, we’ll just say “DevRel,” which is slightly better but not as fun as “Developer Avocado.”

As you might expect, titles aren’t standardized. In theory, they are different roles, but the reality is everyone performs some ill-defined mix of all these roles. The best you might observe in titling trends is that “Evangelist” is on its way out (too much “I’m telling you to use my product”), and “Advocate” and “Developer Experience” are on the way up (more focus on being the user’s champion internally, or making the conversation a “two-way street”). However, the shift in titles may not track closely with the actual behaviors and incentives set up by the company.

# Developer Educator

Instead of a company paying you to create content for their products, why not have your audience pay you to create content to teach them? What a novel idea! This is the territory of the developer-educator, a title I just made up, because “instructor” or “trainer” felt too bland.

# Entrepreneurship

Finally, there is the category of entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs range from one-person developer educator businesses and solo “indie hackers” to bootstrapped or indie startups and full-on venture-backed startups. As someone who can code, you can create something of great, scalable value with your bare hands, and that is a mighty power indeed.
