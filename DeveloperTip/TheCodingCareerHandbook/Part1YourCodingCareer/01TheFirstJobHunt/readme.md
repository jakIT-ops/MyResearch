# 1. Introduction: The (First) Job Hunt

## The most critical part of the coding journey

There are plenty of advice articles out there about landing your first developer job. I don’t want to repeat them; you can easily google an endless supply of them for free. However, I also cannot ignore that this is the most critical part of your initial journey.

# 2. Do the Math

### Job search is random

Recognize that the job search is highly random. There really is not that much separating you from an average Google programmer. As [Steve Yegge](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html) has noted, there is a very high false-negative rate at interviews at BigCos, mainly because we are just very bad at interviewing.

### Keep things moving

However, the great thing about jobs is you only need one.

The probability of getting a job is higher if you apply for more positions. I know this sounds obvious, but when you get discouraged (and I have felt it - in my initial job search, I spent a whole week not doing any applications because I didn’t feel motivated), you have to remember to Keep. Things. Moving.

### Job is a number game

The common framing of this is that it’s a “numbers game.” However, people don’t quantify how much just doing more applications does for you; this is actually an applied form of the [Birthday Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem), which is GREAT for you!

# 3. Do the Work

### What is path dependence

However, spamming fifty applications a week is also not great. Beyond the demotivating, soul-sucking aspect of this, blindly taking the first job that comes along can be harmful. Your first dev job will help you build expertise and reputation for your next job. If you end up hating your first job, you may find it a lot harder to get onto a different career track. This is called path dependence. If you’re trying to change careers, you have likely already felt this pain.


### Find the intersection

Instead, try to figure out the intersection of what you like, what you can be good at, and what the world values (Preferably, the world is increasingly valuing this thing, so you have a tailwind behind you. See the Strategy section of this course). You are most likely to get hired, be valued, and love your work when you find the company(ies) that aligns most closely to those three things.


### Talk

Talk to alums of your school or boot camp. Talk to friends. Ask for intros, then talk to friends of friends. Ask for more intros, then talk to friends of friends of friends. Talk to people at meetups and coffee chats. Listen to podcasts (here is a list of awesome dev podcasts). Chat on Reddit, Slack, and Twitter.

### Why you should network

You should network not with the sole intention of “Hey, can you put me in as a referral if I buy you a coffee?” Rather, you want to genuinely find out what people really do, what people think of the industry and their company, and wherein the Coding Career Layers you could fit. People like to talk about themselves. Don’t ask for a job or a referral (unless they bring it up). If you are genuinely curious, they’ll bring it up themselves, and it will be their idea.

# 4. Getting the Interview

## Recruiters

Recruitment agencies vary wildly in quality, and their usefulness varies from location to location. Keep in mind that you are a product to them; their business model is to throw as many viable bodies at their client as acceptable in the hope one sticks.

## Portfolios

You don’t need an all-singing, all-dancing portfolio page. You don’t need a verdant green commit history. People barely look at that. They don’t have time. You just have to demonstrate that you’ve done cool shit and, optionally, covered your bases.

## Resumes

You do need to be able to talk well about whatever you put on your resume, so make sure that everything on there is legit. Keep it one page; [use this template for ideas](https://www.careercup.com/resume). [Use Canva Resume templates](https://www.canva.com/templates/search/resumes/) to make it visually interesting.

For whatever reason, interviewers often print out your resume, bring it to the interview, and then stare at it instead of talking to you like a normal human being.

Have two to three different versions of your resume prepared to tell the story that you want to tell— ditto with your cold email draft, self-intro, or cover letter. Learn from modern internet advertising: MORE TARGETING IS ALWAYS GOOD.

## Cover letters

A cover letter shows that you know what the job is about and have taken the time to personalize your pitch. A good cover letter makes reviewers sit up and pay attention; sometimes, this calls for creative measures.

Cover letters can be componentized:

* Write three different forms of self-introduction.

* Write a middle part that directly responds to line items in the job ad.

* Write a few boilerplate endings.

* Play mix and match for each company, matching the tone and relevance of your background to the job in question.

## Mock interviews

You can get over a lot of nerves by just having a few friends (or a professional) put you through some mock interviews. You can even find some videos and podcasts that coach you through a mock interview. Remember that they’re not merely assessing whether you can come up with the right solution. They’re also looking for your communication skills, eagerness to learn, and problem-solving process. Some hiring managers are so open that you can even find out the kind of questions they like to ask, based on their own tweets and media appearances. Research them and practice answering them.

# Types of Interviews

### System design interviews

You won’t get a ton of this as a junior, especially not for frontend roles. However, it will still be rewarding to read through HiredInTech’s guide, High Scalability’s top posts, and checking out the System Design repo. You’re more likely to actually need this information when you get to a senior level.

### Algorithms

You don’t have to be an algorithms god, but you should know the basics, like having a passing familiarity with the main ideas in Gayle McDowell’s Cracking the Coding Interview or Emma Bostian’s Decoding the Technical Interview Process, memorizing and being able to derive the Big O’s of sorting algorithms, and so on.

Even a Google technical interview is at most 45 minutes of coding; that is not enough time to write a self-balancing red-black tree and barely enough to code up a heap sort from scratch. Just know the basics; Byte by Byte’s list of 50 Questions is indicative of the difficulty level of algorithm questions. Paid sites like Educative, Leetcode, and Algoexpert can help you practice.


### Technical interviews

This topic is well covered by others and is very domain-specific, so it is out of the scope of this course, but definitely check out the Mega Interview Guide and Coding Interview University. However, the broad adage of “Make it work, make it right, and make it fast” applies.

As you tackle the problem, it’s important to explain your thinking process. A detailed framework you can use is the REACTO model:

* Repeat the question

* Come up with examples

* Outline your approach

* Code your solution

* Test your code

* Optimize your code

If you have a running environment to code in, it may be a good idea to do Test Driven Development for your code (flip the testing and coding stages). I once specifically got an offer because I chose to do TDD while trying to understand the question (It wasn’t a conscious decision!).

### Blind interviews

A lot of unconscious bias happens in interviews. It’s an unfair reality. You can’t help how you look, who you are, or how they adjust for their own biases, but just know that blind interviews exist to help mitigate that injustice. Interviewing.io, Byteboard, and Pramp even let you do practice interviews anonymously and actually get hired from there.

### Take-home projects

You can consider these as “enhanced technical interviewing.” They are wonderful for the new developer. I have had two job offers based on successful take-home projects. There is a lot of freedom in how you complete these:

* You can choose to go all out and risk being messy by showing how you would work on a real project (including architecting for scale and including other niceties that they didn’t ask for but would in real life), with a risk of failure.

* Or, you could do a minimal, super clean project that just checks all the required user stories and nothing more, making it extremely well documented and tested.

### Over-communicate

Comment freely in your code and, in general, find ways to demonstrate that you can communicate well. In one of my take-home projects, they set up a Slack channel to discuss my work with me, and I constantly spammed my channel with status updates as I did the project. They loved interacting with me and gave me the offer.

### Non-technical/fit interviews

Arrive early. Think of the most confident person you know and channel them just for this interview. You are on stage. You are not just interviewing for a role; you are playing a role. Smile. Keep eye contact. All the advice from How to Win Friends and Influence People works here. Have your self-intro rehearsed and in under a minute. Try to research your interviewers beforehand. Get them to talk (Most people love talking about themselves and find themselves liking you more the more they talk.).


### Reverse interviews

If someone asks if you have any questions, ask a question. This is known as a “reverse interview.” The most famous of these was the Joel test, which is a little outdated today. You can consider this updated list instead. Asking good questions about company culture can both make you look good (you appear serious about the job and also know how to ask good questions) and help you make your final decision. So it makes sense to prepare these questions beforehand!
