# 1. Private vs. Public

### Learning in private

You have been trained your entire life to learn in private. You go to school. You do your homework. You get grades. And you keep what you learned to yourself.

Success is doing this better than everyone else around you, over and over again. It is a constant, lonely, zero-sum race to get the best grades. To get into the best colleges. To get the best jobs. If you’ve had a prior career, the chances are that all your work was confidential. And of COURSE, you don’t share secrets with competitors!


### Learning in public

There is another way. You can learn in public instead.

You build a public record of your interests and progress, and along the way, you attract a community of mentors, peers, and supporters. They will help you learn faster than you ever could on your own. Your network can be vast, consisting of experts in every field, unconstrained by your org chart.

# 2. Teach to Learn

### The best way to learn in public

“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”

- Albert Einstein

Did I mention that teaching is the best way to learn in public? You only truly know something when you’ve tried teaching it to others. All at once, you are forced to check your assumptions, introduce prerequisite concepts, structure content for completeness, and answer questions you never had.

### Learn to talk with your code

Probably the most important skill in teaching is learning to talk while you code. It can be stressful, but you can practice it like any other skill. It turns a mundane talk into a captivating high-wire act. It makes pair programming a joy rather than a chore.

# 3. Mentors, Mentees, and Becoming an Expert

### Pick up what they put down

Experts notice genuine learners. They’ll want to help you. Don’t tell them; they just became your mentors. This is so important that I’m repeating it: pick up what they put down.

### Why seniors will teach you

“With so many junior devs out there, why would they help me?” you ask.

Because you learn in public. By teaching you, they teach many. You amplify them. You have the one thing they don’t: a beginner’s mind. See how this works?

### Become a mentor

At some point, people will start asking you for help because of all the stuff you put out. 99% of developers are "dark,” meaning they don’t write or speak or participate in public tech discourse. But you do. You must be an expert, right? Your impostor syndrome will strike here but ignore it. Answer as best as you can. When you’re stuck or wrong, pass it up to your mentors.
