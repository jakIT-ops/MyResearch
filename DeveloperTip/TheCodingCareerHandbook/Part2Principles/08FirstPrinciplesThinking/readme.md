# 1. Introduction: First Principles Thinking

## What is first principle thinking?

First Principles Thinking (FPT) starts from unequivocal base facts and builds up toward some vision or explanation of reality. It involves reasoning by deduction rather than by analogy or appeal to authority. It’s been called the "dumbest thing smart people do.

## Big O Notation and FPT

Big O Notation is many developers’ first brush with FPT. As a developer, learning to reason from first principles makes you see the bigger picture behind all the engineering work you do, from project estimation to technology evaluation. As you get comfortable with your tools, you should start to look beyond them toward their underlying patterns and limitations. This is one of the key transitions you will make in the transition from junior to senior.

## Think beyond labels

Push yourself to think beyond labels. Questions like “is it production ready?” or “does it scale?” or “is it blazing fast?” have very little meaning absent your own context. For a hilarious take on this, check out this parody video discussing the technical merits of Node.js between two developers. It’s funny because it is true. So many beginner developers, and too many senior developers, think and talk with labels and never go past that. Learn to break down how things work and derive your own answers based on first principles.

## Break down the problem

When you are told that something cannot be done, first principles will help you ask, “Why Not?” Conversely, if you are being tasked with something impossible, first principles will help you quickly demonstrate nonviability by breaking down the problem into a set of base facts.

# 2. Logic

Logic is the analysis and appraisal of arguments.

I first encountered this via a philosophy lecturer I had in junior college, Lionel Barnard (he was actually supposed to teach Economics but preferred to turn our class into a little PPE program for our intellectual gratification).

In particular, I have always favored the format of syllogism, which takes a form like this:

* 1: All men are mortal.
* 2: All Greeks are men.
* Therefore: all Greeks are mortal.

### Supplant your syllogisms with axioms

However, you can’t get very far if you only rely on facts because there are many more unknowns and indeterminate, or stochastic, processes than there are facts. So, you can supplant your syllogisms with axioms.

# 3. Applications

### Systems Thinking

More generally, a quantifiable set of first principles for any system is [now in vogue as Systems Thinking](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/), quoting Donella Meadows:

"PLACES TO INTERVENE IN A SYSTEM (in increasing order of effectiveness):

12- Constants, parameters, numbers

11- The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows

10- The structure of material stocks and flows

9- The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change

8- The strength of negative feedback loops

7- The gain around driving positive feedback loops

6- The structure of information flows

5- The rules of the system

4- The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure

3- The goals of the system

2- The mindset or paradigm out of which the system arises

1- The power to transcend paradigms"
