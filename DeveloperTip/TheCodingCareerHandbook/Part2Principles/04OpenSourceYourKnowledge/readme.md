# 1. Introduction: Open Source your Knowledge

### History of Linux

Open source code wasn’t always the norm.

The Unix operating system was created in the 1970s and freely licensed to academic and business institutions for a decade before Bell Labs decided to charge for it as a proprietary product. Frustrated with this, Linus Torvalds created and released Linux in 1991. Today, 97% of web servers run Linux.

### Today’s software

Similarly, most software you use today is open source. The expectation is that the open-source alternative to a closed source codebase will eventually win.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL has superseded Oracle in every dimension, from features to developer experience, on a fraction of the budget.

### Anders Hjelsberg

Anders Hjelsberg, the creator of Turbo Pascal, Delphi, J++, C#, and TypeScript, now says no language will be a closed source ever again. Can you imagine having to pay a company just to use a language?

### Proprietary application code

Even in proprietary application code, 97% of it is open source libraries and components, according to npm.

# 2. Open Knowledge

## What is open knowledge?

We can all do more to share knowledge openly. Open knowledge is polished, highly produced information shared in public, like books, blog posts, cheat sheets, talks, libraries, and, increasingly, data, which the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/) promotes.

## Personal anecdote

In my former Finance career, everything I did was the property of my fund, and we never shared our insights to advance the industry. This arises from a zero-sum view of value creation. It’s a shame. I did some of the best work of my life in that job, and it is trapped in some mailbox somewhere. Nobody will ever see it again. Not even me.

## The tech industry is open

The tech industry is fundamentally more open. This is wonderful. Now, we not only share most of our secrets, but we can also get up on stage, tell our peers about it, and get rewarded! Every company understands the value of blogging, and we often even give away our code.

# 3. Tips

### Optimize for copy and paste

The most immediate value you can provide to yourself and others is to offer copy-and-pasteable examples. Make the examples clearly self-contained, well-annotated, and made for copy and paste.

### Help others help their friends

When people look good by linking to your work, you look good. So, be timeless, and don’t add junk like ads and random jokes.

### Add an open license

Just like you should license your code, make it explicit that people are welcome to read, contribute, and fork your accumulated knowledge and what attributions you require.

### Look out for under-served community needs

Just like with any venture, it is not a requirement that you be the first or only attempt to do something. However, it can help you get initial traction. The intersections of the two domains are usually under-served. This helps your effort be tractable (don’t bite off more than you can chew) and resonant (do people say, “Hell yeah! I wish I’d seen this when I started!”)

### The structure is as important as content

Your role is as much organizing information as it is providing information. Everything down to the relative length of sections, the structure of headings, and even what not to include is worth paying attention to.

### Ask for specific help

If you have known gaps in your knowledge, ask for help there rather than ask for general help. It may or may not come, but at least you stand a higher chance. The world punishes the vague wish and rewards the specific ask.

### Internal OSK

Not all information should be public. But you can still do extremely well open-sourcing knowledge internally in a company.
