### Summary

* JavaScript is a programming language created in 1995 for adding interactivity to web pages. Still the language of the web, it has also pervaded many other environments: servers, mobile devices, connected objects, etc.

* JavaScript has been standardized under the name ECMAScript and is continuously improved. Its latest major version is ES2021.

* JavaScript is dynamically typed: the type of a variable is deduced from the value stored in it.

* JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language: you can write programs using an imperative, object-oriented or functional programming style.

* JavaScript’s object-oriented model is based on prototypes.

* When run into a browser, JavaScript can use the DOM (Document Object Model) to access and update dynamically the structure of a web page.

* JavaScript can send AJAX calls (asynchronous HTTP requests) to exchange data with web servers or use web APIs, enabling the creation of web applications.

* The Node.js platform, created in 2009 and built on Chrome’s V8 engine, brought JavaScript outside the browser.

* Node emphasizes modularity. Its npm package registry is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
