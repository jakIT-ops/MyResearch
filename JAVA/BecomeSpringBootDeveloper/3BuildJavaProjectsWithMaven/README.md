Software is written by multiple teams and dozens of people in corporations that depend on already tested and released software components. This is very different from how students are taught to write software in undergraduate programs, and often the first struggle a new hire contends with is working effectively with the build ecosystem of a company. One of the major components in a build system is the build tool; Maven is the most popular build tool for Java products. Maven is much more than a build tool as we will learn. It can be used to manage an entire project. There are tools similar to Maven that are listed below:

* Ant

* Gradle

* Ivy

* Gulp

* Grunt

* Leiningen

* GNU Make
