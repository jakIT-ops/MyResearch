The security pillar includes the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. The security pillar provides an overview of design principles, best practices, and questions

## Design Principles

There are six design principles for security in the cloud:

### Implement a strong identity foundation:

Implement the principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with the appropriate authorization for each interaction with your AWS resources. Centralize privilege management and reduce or even eliminate reliance on long-term credentials.

### Enable traceability:

Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real-time. Integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action.

### Apply security at all layers:

Rather than just focusing on protecting a single outer layer, apply a defense-in-depth approach with other security controls. Apply to all layers, for example, edge network, virtual private cloud (VPC), subnet, load balancer, every instance, operating system, and application.

### Automate security best practices:

Automated software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost-effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.

### Protect data in transit and at rest:

Classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption and tokenization where appropriate. Reduce or eliminate direct human access to data to reduce the risk of loss or modification.

### Prepare for security events:

Prepare for an incident by having an incident management process that aligns with your organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.

# Basics of Securing Your Cloud

## Security on the cloud consists of

1. Infrastructure Structure Security

2. DDoS Mitigation

3. Data Encryption

4. Inventory & Configuration

5. Monitoring and Logging

### Infrastructure Structure Security

Several security capabilities and services to increase privacy and control network access. These include: Network firewalls built into the VPC and web application firewall capabilities using WAF will let you create private networks and control access to your instances and applications Encryption in transit with TLS across all services Connectivity options that enable private, or dedicated, connections from your office or on-premises environment

### DDoS Mitigation

A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example, a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. Availability is of paramount importance in the cloud. Customers benefit from DDoS protection services and technologies built from the ground up to provide resilience in the face of DDoS attacks. Some services like auto-scaling also are designed with an automatic response to DDoS to help minimize time to mitigate and reduce impact.

### Data Encryption

AWS offers you the ability to add an additional layer of security to your data at rest in the cloud, providing scalable and efficient encryption features. This includes:

Data encryption capabilities are available in AWS storage and database services, such as EBS, S3, Glacier, Oracle RDS, SQL Server RDS, and Redshift.

Flexible key management options, including AWS Key Management Service, allow you to choose whether to have AWS manage the encryption keys or enable you to keep complete control over your keys.

Encrypted message queues for the transmission of sensitive data using server-side encryption (SSE) for Amazon SQS.

Dedicated, hardware-based cryptographic key storage using AWS CloudHSM, allowing you to satisfy compliance requirements.

### Inventory & Configuration

The Cloud range of tools allows you to move fast while still ensuring that your cloud resources comply with organizational standards and best practices. This includes:

A security assessment service like Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices, including impacted networks, OS, and attached storage.

Deployment tools to manage the creation and decommissioning of AWS resources according to organization standards.

Inventory and configuration management tools, including AWS Config, that identify AWS resources and then track and manage changes to those resources over time.

Template definition and management tools, including CloudFormation to create standard, pre-configured environments.

### Monitoring and Logging

The cloud provides tools and features that enable you to see exactly whatâ€™s happening in your environment. This includes:

Deep visibility into API calls, including who, what, who, and from where calls were made.

Log aggregation options, streamlining investigations, and compliance reporting.

Alert notifications through CloudWatch when specific events occur or thresholds are exceeded.

These tools and features give you the visibility you need to spot issues before they impact the business and allow you to improve security posture, and reduce the risk profile, of your environment.
