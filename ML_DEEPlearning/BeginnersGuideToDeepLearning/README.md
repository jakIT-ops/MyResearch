### Traditional programming vs. machine learning

In traditional programming, the algorithm is known and a function is written to produce the output. In Machine learning, you know the input and the output but the algorithm is the unknown that produces the output.

## Supervised machine learning#

In supervised learning, the training data features are provided as input to the algorithm which also includes the output labels. The algorithms map the input to the output by using the provided input-output pairs.

Some common examples of supervised Machine learning are:

### Classification

A machine is trained to classify the given data into a class.

For example:

* Classifying whether a patient has a disease or not

* Classifying whether an email is spam or not

### Regression

A machine is trained to predict a continuous value like the price, the weight, or the height.

For example:

* Predicting house/stock market price

* Predicting temperature

## Unsupervised machine learning

In unsupervised learning, the training data is provided to the machine without labels. The machine needs to discover the relationship in the data.

Some common examples of unsupervised learning are:

### Clustering

A machine is trained to discover groupings of similar data.

For example:

* Grouping objects in an image by color, shape, and size

* Grouping customers by purchase behavior

## Association

A machine is trained to discover interesting relationships between variables in large databases.

For example:

* By understanding customer buying habits by finding correlations and associations between different items that customers place in their shopping basket, recurring patterns can be derived.

## Reinforcement learning

In reinforcement learning, the machines or agents learn the ideal behavior within a specific context. The agent observes the environment to which it is exposed. Then it selects and executes actions. In return, it receives rewards or penalties.

Some common examples of reinforcement learning are:

* Robotics — Making the robots learn novel behaviors through trial and error interactions.

* Game Playing — Determining the best move to make in a game.


## Machine learning vs. deep learning

There are two key reasons that make deep learning more special than machine learning:

1. Decision Boundary

2. Feature Engineering

### Decision boundary

In the case of classification problems, the algorithm learns the mapping function that separates the two classes. This is known as a Decision boundary. A Decision boundary helps determine whether a given data point belongs to a positive or negative class.

### Feature engineering

Feature engineering is the most important step when building the model for a prediction task. It involves feature extraction and feature selection. In feature extraction, all the required features for the given problem are extracted. In feature selection, all important features are selected so that it can improve the performance of the model.
