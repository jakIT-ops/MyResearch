### Problem statement

You are provided with a list of learning rates in the code below. Use the `SGD` optimizer and observe the effect of different learning rates. In short, define the compile and the fit method for the given set of learning rates.

* Compile the model with the SGD optimizer.

* Fit the model on the training data with 20 epochs and 10 batch_size.

### Sample input

List of learning rates

```py
learning_rates = [0.000001, 0.01, 0.1, 1]
```

### Sample output


Model accuracy on different learning rates
