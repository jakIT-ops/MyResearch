### Problem statement

Code the feedforward propagation algorithm for a 3 layered neural network.

> 📝 1. Apply the sigmoid activation function to the net hidden layer outputs respectively.

> 📝 2. Apply the softmax activation function to the net output of the final layer.

### Sample input

* The input features X

* The weights of the three layers, w1, w2, and w3 respectively

* The bias of the three layers b1, b2, and b3 respectively

### Sample output#

The output at 3 layers after applying the activation function. For example:

* Output at hidden layer 1

* Output at hidden layer 2

* Output at the final layer
