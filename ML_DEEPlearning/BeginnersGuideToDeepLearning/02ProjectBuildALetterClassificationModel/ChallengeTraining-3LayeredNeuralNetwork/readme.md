### Problem statement

Train the 3 layered neural network.

* Call the forward_propagation function.

* Call the error function calculate_error and save the loss in each epoch.

* Call the backpropagation function.

* Call the update_parameters function to update the weights and biases in each epoch.

### Sample input

* The input features: X

* The target output: y

* The weights of the three layers: w1, w2, and w3 respectively

* The bias of the three layers b1, b2, and b3 respectively

* Total epochs: epochs

* The learning rate: learning_rate

### Sample output

* The updated weights and biases at the three layers respectively, i.e., w1, b1, w2, b2,w3, and b3

* The cross-entropy loss in each epoch saved in the losses array
