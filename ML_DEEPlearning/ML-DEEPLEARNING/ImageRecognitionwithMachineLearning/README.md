* Take raw images and process them into usable data for machine learning. This includes techniques such as image standardization, image resizing, and data augmentation.

* Build a CNN from scratch and different variations of the CNN such as SqueezeNet and ResNet.

* Use a CNN to perform different types of image recognition, from digit recognition to classifying the ImageNet dataset.
