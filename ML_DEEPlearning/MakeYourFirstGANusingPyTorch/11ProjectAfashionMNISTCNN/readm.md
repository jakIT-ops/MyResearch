## Challenge: Define the Convolution Neural Network Architecture

#### Problem statement

The dataset for this challenge is taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist), which contains the data in a CSV format.

Letâ€™s go over the dataset first. The dataset has similar dimensions to the MNIST dataset. The FMNISTDataset class is the same as that of the MNIST class defined [here](https://www.educative.io/courses/make-your-first-gan-pytorch/mERBkGK3Vyp).
