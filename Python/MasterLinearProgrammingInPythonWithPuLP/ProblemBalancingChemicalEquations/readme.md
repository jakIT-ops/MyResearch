### Overview of the problem

Balancing a chemical equation essentially means respecting the conservation of mass and ensuring that the same number of atoms of an element are present on the left-hand side (reactants) and the right-hand side (products). Simply put, if you have X grams of an element as a reactant, the product will also have X grams of that element in the products (ideal conditions).

In the figure above, we can notice the following:

* In the unbalanced equations, there are 2 atoms of H and Cl in the products. However, there is only a single atom of H and Cl in the reactants. This does not respect the law of conservation of mass.

* In the balanced equation, we are using 2 atoms of H and Cl in the reactants. The number of atoms in the products remains unchanged. As a result, the equation is balanced because it no longer violates the law of conservation of mass.

The equation above was easy to solve and can be done manually. However, things get complicated as the number of elements increases and the number of reactants and products increases. For example, the equation below can be solved manually but will require a fair amount of trial and error before that can happen.
